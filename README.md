# RunBatchFileWithoutTerminal

This program allows you to run a batch file in the background without opening a terminal window. I created this project as I was annoyed by scheduled batch files causing the terminal to briefly flash on the screen throughout the day.

## Getting Started

Simply launch the program with the path to the batch file as an argument.

## Compatibility

This program is compatible with all versions of Windows that support .NET Framework 4.7.2.

## License

This program is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.
